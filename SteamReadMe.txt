[h1]Quasimorph Pause on production[/h1]


[h1]Important - This version of the mod is only for the opt in beta version of the game![/h1]

This is a temporary version that supports the 0.8.6 beta, and not the current game's version.
For the non beta version of the game, use the mod of the same name without the BETA suffix.

The non beta version [i]must[/i] be uninstalled.
When the 0.8.6 becomes the main version, this mod will be deleted.
Note that the beta is expected to change many times before release.
As such, this mod may break on each beta release.

[h1]Docs[/h1]

When the last item in a queue is produced, the game will be paused and the production screen will be opened.
